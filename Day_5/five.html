                <!-- The below is the content part of the web page .-->
                <p>
                    Coffee came to India well before the East India company, through an India Sufi saint named "Baba
                    Budan". The first record of coffee growing in India is following the introduction of coffee beans
                    from Yemen by Baba Budan to the hills of Chikmagalur, Karnataka in 1670.
                    Since then coffee plantations have become established in the region, extending south to Kodagu.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_India">Coffee production in India</a> is
                    dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of Karnataka accounting 53%
                    followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. Indian coffee is said to be
                    the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct sunlight anywhere in the world.
                    There are approximately 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% of them are small growers. As of 2009,
                    the production of coffee in India was only 4.5% of the total production in the world.
                    Almost 80% of the country's coffee production is exported.
                    Of that which is exported, 70% is bound for Germany, Russian federation, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia,
                    United States, Japan, Greece, Netherlands and France, and Italy accounts for 29% of the exports.
                    Most of the export is shipped through the Suez Canal.
